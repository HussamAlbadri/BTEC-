# APIs and SDK

1)
- Open APIs, often known as Public APIs, are APIs that are generally available to developers and other users. They could ask for registration, an API Key, or OAuth authorization, or they could be entirely accessible. They concentrate on external users in order to gain access to data or services.

- APIs exposed by/to strategic business partners are known as partner APIs. They are not accessible to the general public and require specific authorization. Partner APIs, like open APIs, are the tip of the iceberg since they are the most visible and are used to communicate outside of the company's limits. They're usually accessible through a public API developer portal where developers can self-serve. While open APIs are totally available, access to partner APIs requires an onboarding process that includes a unique validation workflow.

- Internal APIs, also known as private APIs, are accessible solely by internal systems and are hidden from external users. Internal APIs aren't intended for use outside of the firm; rather, they're meant to be shared within different internal development teams to improve efficiency and reuse of services. Exposing them to an internal API developer site that connects to internal IAM systems to authenticate and authorize users to access the proper set of APIs is part of a sound governance procedure.

- **Efficiency**

By enabling API access, material can be written once and then automatically distributed or made available across several channels. Your agency's content is ready for easy sharing and redistribution so that more folks can benefit from your purpose.

- **Wider Reach**

APIs can be used to provide services and information to new audiences and in specific contexts that can be customized to give personalized user experiences by allowing anyone to develop a new presentation layerâ€”like an app, a website, or a widget. People who don't visit your website can acquire information or services from your agency through applications or other websites they frequent.

- **Partnerships**

Like-minded non-profits and enterprises who are interested in using agency information and services to deliver services augment each agency's goal. They accomplish this through consuming and reusing agency content into new, useful products, as well as exposing agency content to their customers and clients. This can encourage creativity because any person with a brilliant idea could come up with the next big thing for your community.

- **Integration**

APIs make it easier to embed or intertwine your content across your websites or other applications. As a result, you may provide the user with a seamless and integrated user experience as well as relevant and up-to-date information. The information is provided to them wherever it will be relevant.

3) Because SDKs frequently include an API, there isn't a direct answer to how an SDK and an API difference.
When a developer utilizes an SDK to build systems and applications, those applications must communicate with each other. An SDK contains an API that allows for this connection. However, while the API can be used for communication, it cannot be utilized to develop a new application.

The basic distinction is that an API is merely an interface for a service, whereas an SDK is a collection of tools, components, and code fragments built for a specific purpose.
