# Task 2

 In this section i will talk about some software tools that we use into our projects,but before this let's make some comparisons between the mentioned tools:

 So, let's start:

 ## The IDE's

 Visual Studio Code | PyCharm
 -------------|-------------

 ### Pycharm

It is one of the most commonly used IDEs for Python programming. PyCharm was created for Python Programming.
The extensions and plugins are all designed to make the Python development process go more smoothly.
MySQL and Oracle are among the built-in python databases and libraries in PyCharm.
PyCharm is compatible with all operating systems, including Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows.

### Visual Studio Code

VSCode is a source code editor with limited features in terms of an integrated development environment (IDE) and text editing. It supports Java, JavaScript, and C++, many other programming languages.

It doesn't use the system design, but it does allow users to create and save multiple directories. In VS Code options, users can exclude unnecessary data from a project.


**Why do I choose VS Code insted of Pycharm?**

Vs code is an open-sourse platform, the API and the developing tools inside this platform is so helpful, and more userfriendly.



-----------------------

## Operating Systems


 Linux | Windows
 -------------|-------------

Windows is one of Microsoft's operating systems, sometimes known as a computer operating system (OS).
Each operating system comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays all files, videos, and other media.
As a result, almost every PC or laptop manufacturer now includes the Windows operating system.


Linux is an open-source operating system based on the UNIX operating system that was initially released in 1991. It's a form of computer application that runs on top of all other software. It's an open-source operating system, thus it's free.

**What type of OS do i use?**

I used to use windows for a years. but, if we want to talk about the flexibility (Linux) is the better choice.

---------------------
## Version-Control Platform 

GitHub | GitLab
 -------------|-------------

### GitHub

GitHub is a free repository hosting platform that combines all of a developer's issue tracking and code management needs in one manageable way. GitHub is so well-known that it's almost convertible with Git.

There are huge number of open-source code repositories are hosted on GitHub. Given that it was the only platform of its kind at the time of its introduction, this is expected. There are few free services that provide the same level of essential functionality.


### GitLab

GitLab, unlike GitHub, was created as a testing platform rather than a repository hosting service.   GitLab has always been first and primarily a collaboration tool, then a repository, with CI/CD at its base.

GitLab's primary product maintained open source as it expanded in popularity, breaking into code bases. The community edition was designed for individuals and open source projects. There was also the Enterprise Edition, which was created to provide organizations with the tools they needed.

**What type of Version-Control Platform  do i use?**

Github, because most of my work depend on storing the data or the projects that i made into a platform that hosts these repostories not a testing platform.
